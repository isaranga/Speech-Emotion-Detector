# Speech Emotion Detector

As part of my undergraduate program at the Open University of Israel (B.Sc. in Computer Science), I did this project with a partner for the course "Workshop in Data Science". Our goal was to develop a tool for detecting and classifying emotions in human speech (e.g. "happy", "angry", "calm", etc.) using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. We called this tool *Speech Emotion Detector*.

This project includes:
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Various algorithms and models: K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, Autoencoders, CNN and more
